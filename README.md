# pgp-devops

## Project Description

 You are working with multiple DevOps Engineers to build a Docker Jenkins Pipeline.

### Project Requirements

**The tasks you are responsible for:**

* Availability of the application and its versions in the GitHub
  * Track their versions every time a code is committed to the repository

* Create a Docker Jenkins Pipeline that will create a Docker image from the Dockerfile and host it on Docker Hub

* It should also pull the Docker image and run it as a Docker container

* Build the Docker Jenkins Pipeline to demonstrate the continuous integration and continuous delivery workflow

**You must use the following tools:**

* Docker: To build the application from a Dockerfile and push it to Docker Hub
* Docker Hub: To store the Docker image
* GitHub: To store the application code and track its revisions
* Git: To connect and push files from the local system to GitHub
* Linux (Ubuntu): As a base operating system to start and execute the project
* Jenkins: To automate the deployment process during continuous integration


Following requirements should be met:

    Document the step-by-step process from the initial installation to the final stage

    Track the versions of the code in the GitHub repository

    Availability of the application in the Docker Hub

    Track the build status of Jenkins for every increment of the project
